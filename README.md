## Altimit Engine

Altimit is designed on top of a flexible protocol for building an open Metaverse. Altimit can be used as an engine for creating your own metaverse application, or as a plugin in another toolkit.

In Altimit, every interaction boils down to <b>data and data changes</b>. This simple starting point is the basis for Altimit's architecutre—enabling it to be maximally flexible and compatible with existing protocols.

## Open Source

<i>The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".</i>

Altimit is free for anyone to use and contribtue to. The goal of this project—if one is to be defined—is to create a metaverse engine maximally beneificial for developers. A lot of metaverse claims exist, but Altimit hopes to deliver.

## Compatibility

Altimit is currently compatible with Godot, Unity and native Windows development tools, with support planned for native macOS and iOS in the near future.
