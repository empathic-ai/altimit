## Altimit Engine

The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".

Altimit is designed from a flexible protocol for building an open Metaverse. Use Altimit as an engine for creating your own metaverse application, or as a plugin in your development environment of choice.

Altimit is currently compatible with Godot and Unity, with support planned for native iOS in the near future.
