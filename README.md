## Altimit Engine

The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".

Altimit is designed from a flexible protocol for building an open Metaverse. Use Altimit as an engine for creating your own metaverse application, or as a plugin in your development environment of choice.

Altimit is currently compatible with Godot, Unity and native Windows development tools, with support planned for native macOS and iOS development tools in the near future.
