## Altimit

Altimit is a flexible set of tools and protocols for building an open Metaverse. You can use Altimit as an engine for creating your own desktop/AR/VR application, or as a plugin for creating a Metaverse application in your favorite game engine or IDE. Altimit allows your application to seamlessly connect with other applications to create a unified experience.

Features of Altimit include:

• Distributed computing: Built-in mesh networking for creating large-scale simulations.

• Serialization: Efficiently cache data for game and business logic.

• Animation: Record network interactions for future playback and create animations for other uses.

• User Interfaces: Easily create complex, scalable, platform-agnostic user interfaces.

In Altimit, every interaction boils down to <b>data and data changes</b>. This basic notion is integral to Altimit's elasticity—enabling it to be compatible with a plethora of third-party editors and frameworks.

## Opening the Metaverse

<i>The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".</i>

Unlike [other](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_kit/common/NVIDIA_Omniverse_License_Agreement.html) Metaverse frameworks, Altimit is entirely free and open source under the MIT License. Anyone is welcome to use and contribute to the engine. The goal of this project—if there is one—is to create super accessible and useful Metaverse tools for all developers and end-users. Let's make the future connected, and let's make it beautiful.

## The Engine

Altimit's Engine is built on top of the Godot Engine, leveraging its cross-platform support and open architecture. It's a fork of the main branch of the Godot Engine with a few additional features and optimizations to provide the best possible experience of Altimit.

Whenever possible, developers are highly encouraged to contribute to the main branch of Godot and/or this repository rather than Altimit's fork of the Godot Engine! Altimit is intended to augment Godot, not detract from its development.

## Plugins

Altimit is available as a plugin for Godot, Unity, native Windows and Linux, with support planned for native macOS and iOS development tools in the near future.
