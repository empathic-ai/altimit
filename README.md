## Altimit Engine

Altimit is a flexible set of tools and protocols for building an open Metaverse. Altimit can be used as an engine for creating your own Metaverse application, or as a plugin for creating a Metaverse application in your favorite game engine or IDE.

Altimit is a networking library. But it is also a set of features built <i>around</i> that library to interface with other applications in a maximally useful way. These features include:

• Distributed computing: Built-in mesh networking for managing large-scale simulations.

• Serialization: Efficiently cache network data.

• Animation: Record network interactions for future playback or create animations for other uses.

• User Interfaces: Easily create complex, scalable, platform-agnostic user interfaces.

In Altimit, every interaction boils down to <b>data and data changes</b>. This basic idea is integral to Altimit's elasticity—enabling it to be compatible with a plethora of third-party editors and frameworks.

## Opening the Metaverse

<i>The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".</i>

Altimit is free for anyone to use and contribute to. The goal of this project—if there is one—is to create Metaverse tools that are maximally beneificial for developers and users. Let's make the future beautiful.

## Compatibility

Altimit is currently compatible with Godot, Unity, native Windows and Linux, with support planned for native macOS and iOS development tools in the near future.
