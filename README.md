## Altimit Engine

Altimit is designed on top of a flexible protocol for building an open Metaverse. Altimit can be used as an engine for creating your own metaverse application, or as a plugin in your favorite game engine or IDE.

Altimit is a networking library. But it is also a set of tools built <i>around</i> that library to interface with external applications in a maximally useful way.

In Altimit, every interaction boils down to <b>data and data changes</b>. This may seem overly-simplistic or like a non-statement, but this grounds Altimit's design—enabling it to be compatible with a plethora of third-party frameworks and protocols.

## Opening the Metaverse

<i>The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".</i>

Altimit is free for anyone to use and contribtue to. The goal of this project—if there is one—is to create a metaverse protocol that is maximally beneificial for developers and the products they want to create for the rest of the world. Let's make the future beautiful.
