## Altimit Engine

Altimit is a flexible set of tools and protocols for building an open Metaverse. Altimit can be used as an engine for creating your own metaverse application, or as a plugin to create your Metaverse application in your favorite game engine or IDE.

Altimit is a networking library. But it is also a set of tools built <i>around</i> that library to interface with foreign applications in a maximally useful way.

In Altimit, every interaction boils down to <b>data and data changes</b>. This basic principal is integral to Altimit's elasticity—enabling it to be compatible with a plethora of third-party toolchains.

## Opening the Metaverse

<i>The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".</i>

Altimit is free for anyone to use and contribute to. The goal of this project—if there is one—is to create a metaverse protocol that is maximally beneificial for developers and consumers. Let's make the future beautiful.
