## Altimit Engine

Altimit is designed on top of a flexible protocol for building an open Metaverse. Altimit can be used as an engine for creating your own metaverse application, or as a plugin in another engine.

In Altimit, every interaction boils down to <b>data and data changes</b>. This simple starting point is the basis for Altimit's architecutre—enabling it to be maximally flexible and compatible with existing protocols.

## Open Source

<i>The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".</i>

Altimit is free for anyone to use and contribtue to. The goal of this project—if there is one—is to create a metaverse protocol that is maximally beneificial for developers. Let's make the future beautiful.

Altimit is currently compatible with Godot, Unity and native Windows development tools, with support planned for native macOS and iOS in the near future.
