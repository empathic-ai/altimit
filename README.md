## Altimit Engine

<i>The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".</i>

Altimit is designed on top of a flexible protocol for building an open Metaverse. Altimit can be used as an engine for creating your own metaverse application, or as a plugin in another toolkit.

In Altimit, every interaction boils down to <b>data and data changes</b>. This simple embracement is the basis for Altimit's architecutre, enabling it to be extremely flexible and capable of interacting with a plethora of existing protocols.

Altimit is currently compatible with Godot, Unity and native Windows development tools, with support planned for native macOS and iOS in the near future.
