## Altimit Engine

Altimit is a flexible set of tools and protocols for building an open Metaverse. You can use Altimit as an engine for creating your own Metaverse application, or as a plugin for creating a Metaverse application in your favorite game engine or IDE. Altimit allows different editors and exported projects to connect with each other to create a unified experience.

Foundationally, Altimit is a networking framework. But it is also a set of features built <i>around</i> that framework to interface with other systems in a maximally useful way. These features include:

• Distributed computing: Built-in mesh networking for creating large-scale simulations.

• Serialization: Efficiently cache network data.

• Animation: Record network interactions for future playback and create animations for other uses.

• User Interfaces: Easily create complex, scalable, platform-agnostic user interfaces.

In Altimit, every interaction boils down to <b>data and data changes</b>. This basic notion is integral to Altimit's elasticity—enabling it to be compatible with a plethora of third-party editors and frameworks.

## Opening the Metaverse

<i>The logical symbol ∀ is used to represent universal quantification in predicate logic, where it is typically read as "for all".</i>

Unlike [other](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/prod_kit/common/NVIDIA_Omniverse_License_Agreement.html) Metaverse frameworks, Altimit is entirely free and open source under the MIT License. Anyone is welcome to use and contribute to it. The goal of this project—if there is one—is to create super accessible and useful Metaverse tools for developers and end-users. Let's make the future connected, and let's make it beautiful.

## Compatibility

Altimit is currently compatible with Godot, Unity, native Windows and Linux, with support planned for native macOS and iOS development tools in the near future.
